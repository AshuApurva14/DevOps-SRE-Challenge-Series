# DevOps/SRE Challenge Day 10 - Solution
## Challenge - The Filesystem Heist


### Challenge Description
You’re securing a server after a botched update. Your mission: navigate the filesystem, manage critical files, secure a new storage vault, collaborate with agents, and archive secrets—all while leaving no trace. Ready?

## Theory Questions
Before you dive into the heist, test your knowledge with these questions. They’re based on the filesystem concepts you’ll need to succeed. Write your answers in a file `~/heist_vault/theory_answers.txt` and check them against the solutions later.
