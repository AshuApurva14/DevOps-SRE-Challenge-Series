#  My Solution of Day 11 - DevOps/SRE Challenge Series
---

- Today's challenge is totally based on linux filesystem operations to test my hands on + theoritical knowledge. 

- This challenge allows to simulate real world task/operations handled by DevOps/SRE Engineers which gives a good amount of real experience.


## Practical Tasks Setup: Linux Text Avengers Training Camp

I joined the Linux Text Avengers, the elite team responsible for manipulating text files to save the world (or at least your systems).I am ready for a series of challenges that will test my text-fu and prepare myself for any text-based crisis.

### 1. Create Your Base of Operations

* Every hero needs a base! So, created my training directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/textlab
cd ~/textlab
```

### 2. The Intelligence File

* My first mission is to analyze an intelligence file. For that I created `myfile.txt` with below vital information:

```bash
cat << EOF > myfile.txt
Line 1: This is a test file. Initializing systems...
Line 2: Administrator access granted. Beware of rogue agents.
Line 3: Memory usage: 500MB. System stable.
Line 4: Error log entry: Unauthorized access attempt detected.
Line 5: IP address: 192.168.1.100. Target server.
Line 6: Password: secret123. DO NOT SHARE.
Line 7: End of file. Mission critical.
EOF
```
