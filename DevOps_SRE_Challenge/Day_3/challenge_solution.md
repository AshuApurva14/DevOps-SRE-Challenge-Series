## Step by step guide for DevOps and SRE beginners to setup GitHub account.

1. Set Up the Environment

  - Installing Git in Linux

    *Linux*  

    **Install Git using the package manager:**

     ``sudo apt install git``    # Debian-based systems  
     ``sudo yum install git``  # RHEL-based systems

    
- Verify installation:
    
    ``git --version``


2. Setting Up GitHub Account

    **GitHub**

 - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up.

 - Confirm your email address.

 - Create two GitHub accounts to simulate code reviews and merging changes.

 - Set up SSH authentication or a Personal Access Token (PAT) for secure access.

2. Clone and Configure Git

  - Fork the Repository: Fork the provided GitHub and GitLab repositories to your own account.
  - Clone the Repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    `git clone https://github.com/AshuApurva14/DevOps-SRE-Challenge-Series.git`

  - Configure Git: Set up your username and email.
   
    `git config --global user.name "Ashu Apurva"`

    `git config --global user.email "ashuapurva@example.com"`




3. Create a Feature Branch and Make Changes

  - Create a new branch for your feature.

     `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

  - Make changes and check the differences before staging:

    

     `git diff`

  - Stage and commit your changes:

   
     `git add .`



     `git commit -m "Added new feature: your-feature-name"`


  - Modify the last commit if needed:

     `git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message with additional changes"`


4. Push Your Changes and Create a Pull Request (PR)


  - Verify the current branch (HEAD position):

     `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`

  - Push your branch to the remote repository:

     `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

  - Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub and a Merge Request (MR) on GitLab.

    *Follow best practices for writing PR descriptions and handling reviews.*


5. Resolve Merge Conflicts

  - Check the current remote repository (origin):

    `git remote -v`

  - Simulate a merge conflict by modifying the same file from another GitHub account.

  - Pull the latest changes and merge.

    `git checkout main`

    `git pull origin main`

    `git checkout feature/your-feature-name`

    `git merge main`

  - Resolve conflicts manually and commit.

    `git add .`

    `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in your-feature-name"`


6.Review and Merge

   - Use your second GitHub account to review and approve the PR.
   - Perform the same review and merge process on GitLab.
   - Merge the PR once approved.


7. Clean Up

   - Delete your feature branch locally and remotely.

     `git branch -d feature/your-feature-name`

     `git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name`

8. Viewing Commit Logs

   - View commit history in different formats:

     `git log --oneline`

     `git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"`

     `git log --stat`

  **Search for specific commit messages:**

    `git log --grep="fix bug"`
