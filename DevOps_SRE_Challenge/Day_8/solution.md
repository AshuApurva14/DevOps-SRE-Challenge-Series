   Download and install both tools on your Windows machine.

2. **Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using PuTTYgen**  
   - Open **PuTTYgen**
   - Click **"Load"** and select your `mykey.pem` file  
   - Click **"Save private key"**  
   - Save it as `mykey.ppk` (you can skip the passphrase if not required)

3. **Open PuTTY and configure connection**  
   - In **Host Name**, enter:  
     ```
     ubuntu@<public-ip>       # For Ubuntu  
     ec2-user@<public-ip>     # For Amazon Linux / RHEL
     ```
   - **Port:** `22`  
   - In the left panel, go to:  
     `Connection` ‚Üí `SSH` ‚Üí `Auth`  
     - Click **Browse**, and attach your `mykey.ppk` file

4. **Connect**
   - Click **"Open"**
   - Accept any security alert
   - You should now be logged into your EC2 instance üéâ

**You are now connected to your VM via PuTTY!**


6. Run this on each:  
   ```bash
   cat /etc/os-release
